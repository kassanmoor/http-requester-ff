HttpRequester is a modified version of the excellent Poster add-on available for Mozilla Firefox.  
HttpRequester is distributed under the the BSD License: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php
1.0.3.1: (09/20/2011):
1) Fixed: Parameters added to the parameter list were only being added to the request URI for GET requests, and not for POST/PUT/DELETE.
2) Fixed: Parameters added to the request URI were not added correctly if the URI already had existing URI query.
3) Fixed: When clicking Parameter Body to move add parameters to the body content, the parameters were still being added to the URI as well.
4) When viewing raw request, response is now separated with a "-- response --" delimiter to aid in readability.
5) Fixed: when executing raw request, was including the response content as part of the PUT/POST body 

1.0.3: (06/05/2011):
1) Added a "Find..." function in the Content Response area and in the Raw Transaction view window.  Press the Find 
button or hit CTRL-f to search for text anywhere in the request/response.  CTRL-g will do a Find Next to locate the 
next instance of the text that was last searched for.

1.0.2: (06/02/2011):
1) Added a column in the transaction history to show Content Length.  The value used is the Content-Length response header 
if available, and the size of the response body otherwise

1.0.1: (05/20/2011):
1) Added a "View raw transaction" link in the Response area to quickly let you view the entire raw request and response.  
This is the same behavior as double-clicking a transaction in the transaction history list.
2) Cleaned up Content area (made selecting a File to upload a radio button control)
3) The response content now properly shows with a scrollbar if there are lots of response headers

1.0: (05/19/2011):
1) The transaction list control has been updated; each column is now resizable and re-orderable and can be hidden via the column picker.  
The ordering and width of each column are now persisted.  Additionally, if a value is too large for a column it will be truncated
and a tooltip will display the full value.
2) The headers and parameters list controls have been similarly updated.


0.5: (03/07/2011): 
1) Updated to work with Firefox 4  
2) Default to "http://" if no protocol is entered

0.4: (02/03/2011)
1) You can now save and load stored requests.   
To save a request, click on a request in the history list and click Save Request.  You can optionally give the request a name.
To load a request, click on Load Request - that will bring up a list of all saved requests.  You can select any request to load it into your history to view it, or you can click the Execute button to execute it immediately.
2) Added explicit Delete Request button to remove selected transaction from history list.  (You can also hit the Delete key)

0.3:  (01/19/2011)
1) History list now shows elapsed time for all requests
2) Double-clicking a row in the history will show you a raw text version of the request and response
3) You can now edit raw requests by clicking the Edit Raw Request button; this is useful for making quick tweaks to a previous request, such as adding or changing a header
4) Paste Request button.  You can now copy existing requests from the clipboard (such as a request captured from Live HTTP Headers) by clicking the
Paste Request button, and then executing the request. 

0.2: (08/01/2010)
1) Reuse HttpRequester window if already open
2) Use HttpRequester icon to identify HttpRequester window

0.1 adds many improvements (07/27/2010)
1) requests/responses transactions now take place in a single window.  A separate window is not opened for each response.
2) history of transactions is now recorded (and kept across sessions); can view past requests; re-execute them
3) HttpRequester opens in a proper window instead of a dialog; can be minimized, maximized
4) remembers recent URLs, header names, and content types (across sessions)
5) can copy a request/response to clipboard for pasting into bug report, etc
6) The UI has been minimialized and cleaned up a bit
7) Can hit <Esc> key to close window

# Details #

This tool is useful when doing web or REST development, or when you need to make HTTP requests that are not easily done via the browser (PUT/POST/DELETE).

This is based off of Alex Milowski's excellent Poster addon, with a large focus on keeping a history of transactions, allowing you to go back and review, re-execute, load, and save HTTP requests.

HttpRequester can be opened via the Tools menu, or via the Addon-bar icon.
